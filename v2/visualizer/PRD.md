# KVizzing Visualizer — Product Requirements Document

## Overview

A web app for browsing, filtering, and exploring the KVizzing question archive. The primary audience is the KVizzing WhatsApp group members — people who asked or answered these questions and want to relive, search, and discover them.

The core navigation model is **calendar-first**: a persistent calendar sidebar gives a temporal overview of all activity, with sessions as named events and ad-hoc question dates as markers. Clicking into a date or session opens the relevant view. Sessions are the primary unit of organisation; individual questions are always surfaced in the context of where they came from.

---

## Goals

1. Make the question archive **browsable and searchable** without needing to scroll WhatsApp
2. Give sessions **first-class treatment** — they are the main events in the group's quiz history
3. Provide a **per-question view** that replays the full discussion thread in context
4. Surface **stats and patterns** — who asks the most, what topics come up, which questions were hardest
5. Celebrate **highlights** — funniest questions, crowd favourites, fastest solves
6. **Gamify exploration** — random question button as the seed for a lightweight quiz-like experience

---

## Data Source

All data comes from `KVizzingQuestion` JSON objects conforming to `v2/schema/schema.json`. The visualizer is read-only — it consumes pre-extracted data, it does not write back.

Primary input: `data/questions.json` — array of all questions sorted by `question.timestamp`.

```

### Mobile

The calendar collapses into a horizontal strip showing the current month with dot indicators per day. A "Calendar" button opens a full-screen calendar overlay.

---

## Calendar Sidebar

The primary navigation mechanism. Always visible on desktop, collapsible on mobile.

### What appears on the calendar

| Event type | Display |
|---|---|
| **Session** | Named event block — quizmaster name + theme (e.g. "Pratik · Hollywood Movies"). Colour-coded per quizmaster. |
| **Ad-hoc questions** | Small dot/badge with count on the date (e.g. `●3`). Not named individually. |
| **Both on same day** | Session event takes the main slot; ad-hoc dot appears below it. |

### Interactions

- **Click a session event** → opens Session View for that session
- **Click an ad-hoc date marker** → opens Question Feed filtered to that date, showing only non-session questions
- **Click an empty date** → no action
- **Month navigation** → prev/next month arrows; "Today" button
- **Year jump** → dropdown to jump to a year directly (useful as the archive grows)

### Visual indicators

- Dates with sessions: highlighted background
- Dates with only ad-hoc questions: subtle dot
- Today: outlined
- Selected date/session: accent colour

---

## Pages & Views

### 1. Session View (Primary)

The most important view. Opened by clicking a session on the calendar or from the Sessions list.

**Header:**
- Session ID, date, quizmaster name, theme (if set)
- Session-level stats: total questions, total participants (unique across all questions), average time to answer, average difficulty

**Question list:**
- All questions in `question_number` order
- Each question rendered as an expanded card (not collapsed) since the user is browsing a specific quiz
- Cards show: question text, answer (revealed), solver, time taken, wrong attempts, difficulty badge, topic badge
- Highlight badges if reactions available
- Clicking a question card opens the Question Detail view

**Navigation:**
- Prev session / Next session arrows (chronological order)
- "Back to Calendar" breadcrumb

**URL format:** `/session/2026-03-16-pratik`

---

### 2. Question Detail

Full view of a single question. Reachable from a session card, the question feed, or a direct URL.

**Context bar (top):**
- If part of a session: `Session: Pratik · Hollywood Movies > Q7` with a link back to the session
- If ad-hoc: `Date: 23 Sep 2025` with a link to the day's question feed

**Sections:**
- Full question text (+ media placeholder if `has_media: true`)
- Answer block — text, solver, confirmation message, collaborative flag, parts breakdown for multi-part questions
- Discussion thread — chronological replay of all `discussion[]` entries, styled by role:
  - `attempt` — speech bubble (green if `is_correct`, grey otherwise)
  - `hint` — italicised nudge from asker
  - `confirmation` — highlighted confirmation message
  - `answer_reveal` — asker reveals without anyone getting it
  - `chat` — muted banter
- Stats panel — wrong attempts, hints given, time to answer, unique participants, difficulty
- Reactions panel — per-emoji counts + category labels (if available)

**Navigation (within session):**
- If opened from a session: Prev question / Next question arrows within that session

**URL format:** `/question/2025-09-23-003`

---

### 3. Question Feed

A filtered/sorted list of questions. Not the primary entry point, but useful for searching across the full archive regardless of session.

**Each card shows:**
- Question text (truncated)
- Asker name + date
- Session badge if applicable (e.g. `Pratik Session · Q7`)
- Topic badge, difficulty badge
- Answer (collapsed by default, expandable)
- Key stats: wrong attempts, time to answer, participant count
- Reaction summary (e.g. `😂 ×3  ❤️ ×2`) if available
- Highlight badges if present

**Search bar (top of feed):**
Keyword search backed by `data/search_index.json` (pre-built from SQLite FTS5). Searches across question text, answer text, and tags.

**Filter bar — full set:**

| Filter | Field | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Asker** | `question.asker` | Dropdown of all askers. "Questions by Pratik." |
| **Solver** | `answer.solver` + `answer.parts[].solver` | Dropdown of all solvers. Matches single-solver answers and any part of multi-part answers. Collaborative questions (no single solver) appear when "Collaborative" is selected. |
| **Topic** | `question.topic` | Multi-select. Only shown if topic enrichment has run. |
| **Tags** | `question.tags` | Multi-select, drawn from `data/tags.json`. |
| **Difficulty** | `stats.difficulty` | Easy / Medium / Hard |
| **Question type** | `question.type` | Factual / Connect / Identify / Fill in blank / Multi-part |
| **Has media** | `question.has_media` | Toggle — show only image/video questions |
| **Collaborative** | `answer.is_collaborative` | Toggle — show only questions solved as a group |
| **Unanswered** | `answer.text == null` | Toggle — show questions that were never solved |
| **Date range** | `date` | Date picker. Pre-sets: This month, Last 3 months, All time. |
| **Session** | `session.id` | Dropdown of all sessions, plus "Ad-hoc only" toggle |
| **Extraction confidence** | `extraction_confidence` | Default: hide `low`. Opt-in toggle to reveal uncertain extractions. |

Active filters are reflected in the URL as query params (e.g. `/feed?topic=history&solver=Saumay`) so filtered views can be shared.

**Sort options:** Newest, Oldest, Most reactions, Hardest (most wrong attempts), Fastest solve, Most participants

---

### 4. Sessions List

A reverse-chronological list of all sessions, as an alternative to finding them on the calendar.

**Each session card shows:**
- Date, quizmaster, theme
- Number of questions
- Average time to answer, average wrong attempts
- Participant count

**URL format:** `/sessions`

---

### 5. Stats & Leaderboards

Aggregate views derived from the full archive.

**Leaderboard tabs:**

| Tab | Metric |
|---|---|
| Top Solvers | Most correct answers |
| Top Askers | Most questions posed |
| Fastest | Lowest average `time_to_answer_seconds` (min 5 questions) |
| Most Engaged | Highest total attempts across questions |

**Charts:**
- Topic breakdown — bar/donut chart of question count by `TopicCategory`, average difficulty per topic
- Difficulty over time — rolling average `wrong_attempts` by month
- Question type distribution — donut chart of `QuestionType`
- Session frequency — bar chart of sessions per month

**URL format:** `/stats`

---

### 6. Highlights Reel

A curated feed of questions with `highlights` populated, sorted by `total_reactions` descending.

**Category filter:** driven by whatever categories exist in the data — not hardcoded (e.g. `funny`, `crowd_favourite`, `spicy`, `surprising`, `confirmed_correct`)

**URL format:** `/highlights`

---

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | **SvelteKit** (static adapter) | Lightest bundle for mobile, first-class static export, built-in transitions for thread replay |
| Styling | **Tailwind CSS** | Utility-first, consistent design tokens, easy responsive layouts |
| Components | **shadcn-svelte** | Accessible, unstyled primitives — full control over appearance |
| Calendar | **FullCalendar** (Svelte adapter) | Battle-tested, handles month/week views, event rendering |
| Charts | **LayerChart** | Svelte-native, lightweight, covers bar/donut/line for stats page |
| Hosting | **Netlify** | Instant cache invalidation, branch previews, better than GitHub Pages |

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Static / no backend** | All data loaded from pre-built JSON files. No server required. |
| **Fast initial load** | `sessions.json` loaded first (small, powers calendar). `questions.json` lazy-loaded. Per-day files used for date-range queries. |
| **Mobile-first** | Members primarily use phones. Calendar collapses to horizontal strip; cards and thread views optimised for small screens. |
| **Extremely good UI** | Smooth transitions on card expand, thread message reveal animation, micro-interactions on filter changes. Not a data dump — feels like a product. |
| **Private by default** | `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">`. Shared only with members via URL. |
| **No login required** | Access by URL only. Frictionless. |
| **Deep linking** | Every session and question has a stable shareable URL. |

---

## Random Question & Gamification

### v2: Random Question Button

A **"Surprise me"** button available on the home screen and the Question Feed. Picks a random question from the current filter context and navigates to its Question Detail view.

**Behaviour:**
- On the home screen (no active filters): picks from the full archive
- Inside the feed with active filters: picks only from the filtered result set — e.g. "Surprise me with a hard history question"
- The button is visually prominent — not buried in the filter bar

**Question Detail in "surprise" mode:**
- Answer is **hidden by default** when arriving via the Random Question button
- A "Reveal answer" button shows the answer + discussion thread
- A "Next random" button picks another question from the same filter context without going back to the feed

This creates a lightweight quiz-like experience: set your filters, hit "Surprise me", try to recall the answer, then reveal.

---

### Future: Gamification Extensions

The random question mechanic is the foundation for future game modes. Planned for post-v2:

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Quiz mode** | Timer shown while answer is hidden. Score tracked locally (fast / slow / gave up). Session summary at the end. |
| **Daily challenge** | One featured question per day, same for all members. Shareable result card ("I got today's KVizzing question in 15 seconds!"). |
| **Streak tracking** | Browser localStorage tracks how many days in a row a member has visited and attempted a question. |
| **Share to WhatsApp** | Deep link that opens the question in the app with a pre-filled message ("Can you get this one? [link]"). |
| **"Try the archive"** | Pick a random question from a specific session — replay a past quiz solo. |

These require no backend — all state (streaks, scores) lives in `localStorage`. The only exception is the daily challenge featured question, which is determined by a pre-built `data/daily.json` generated by the pipeline.

---

## Out of Scope (v1)

- Editing or correcting extracted questions
- Adding new questions manually
- User accounts or personalisation
- Real-time updates from WhatsApp
- Comments or reactions within the visualizer

---

## Open Questions

1. **Media**: `has_media: true` questions reference images/videos not present in `.txt` exports. Show a placeholder, or hide media questions from the feed by default with an opt-in toggle?
2. **Low-confidence questions**: Hide `extraction_confidence: "low"` by default with an opt-in toggle to reveal them?
3. **Quizmaster colours**: Assign a consistent colour per quizmaster for session events on the calendar — derive from name hash, or let it be configurable?
4. **Highlights page without reactions**: Show an empty state with instructions to run `enrich-reactions`, or hide the page entirely until reactions data is present?

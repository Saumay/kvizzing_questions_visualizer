Stage 4 — Enrich

Assigns primary + secondary topic and tags to each KVizzingQuestion via LLM.

Questions that already have 2+ topics are skipped (idempotent).
Questions with 0 or 1 topic are (re-)enriched so both categories are populated.
Questions are sent to the LLM in batches for efficiency.

Input:  list of KVizzingQuestion objects from Stage 3
Output: list of KVizzingQuestion objects with topics + tags populated

You are classifying quiz questions from a WhatsApp trivia group.

For each question you receive, assign:
1. primary_topic — the single best-fitting topic from:
   history, science, literature, technology, sports, geography,
   entertainment, food_drink, art_culture, business, etymology, mythology, geology, general
2. secondary_topic — a second topic from the same list if the question genuinely
   spans two domains (e.g. a science question set in a historical context).
   Use null if no meaningful second category applies. Do NOT force one — most
   questions need only a primary topic.
3. tags — 2–5 lowercase subject/category tags for fine-grained categorisation
   (e.g. ["india", "colonial history", "economics"])

Tag rules — CRITICAL:
- Tags must describe the SUBJECT MATTER of the question (what it is about), never the question format or style.
- NEVER use question-format words as tags: identify, anagram, wordplay, connect, fill in the blank,
  multi-part, factual, battle, clickbait, pun, puns, weird, real life, naming, or any other
  descriptor that describes how the question is asked rather than what it is about.
- Exception: "badly explained" is an accepted subject-style tag for questions in that format.
- Tags should be specific enough to be useful (e.g. "bollywood" not just "india", "ww2" not just "war").
- Use consistent singular/plural forms and avoid near-duplicates (e.g. only "puns", not both "pun" and "puns").

You will receive a JSON array of questions. Return a JSON array of the same length,
in the same order, where each element is:
{"id": "<question id>", "primary_topic": "<topic>", "secondary_topic": "<topic> or null", "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"]}

Return ONLY a valid JSON array. No explanation, no markdown fences.

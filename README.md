# KVizzing

A full-stack platform for extracting, enriching, and visualising trivia questions from the KVizzing WhatsApp group.

---

## What is KVizzing?

KVizzing is a WhatsApp group where members regularly post trivia questions across topics like history, science, literature, technology, sports, cinema, and entertainment. Questions range from quick factual recalls to multi-part identify questions and connect-the-dots puzzles. Members also host curated quiz sessions with themes, scores, and leaderboards.

This project extracts those Q&A threads from raw chat exports and turns them into a structured, searchable archive with a polished web visualizer.

## Data Model

Each extracted Q&A pair is a `KVizzingQuestion` object:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `id` | Stable timestamp-based ID (`YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS`) |
| `question` | Text, asker, type, topics, tags, media attachments |
| `answer` | Text, solver, confirmation, collaborative flag, multi-part breakdown |
| `discussion` | Full ordered message thread (attempts, hints, reveals, elaborations) |
| `stats` | Wrong attempts, hints, time to answer, difficulty |
| `session` | Quizmaster, theme, quiz type, connect answer (null for ad-hoc) |
| `scores_after` | Running scores after each session question |
| `extraction_confidence` | `high` / `medium` / `low` |

See [`v2/schema/schema.py`](v2/schema/schema.py) for the full model.

## Pipeline

The pipeline processes WhatsApp chat exports through 7 stages:

1. **Filter** — Select dates to process, detect backfill gaps
2. **Parse** — Extract structured messages from raw chat text
3. **Extract** — LLM-based Q&A pair extraction with smart chunking and self-healing audit
4. **Structure** — Map to Pydantic models, generate IDs, compute stats
5. **Enrich** — LLM topic categorisation (23 topics)
6. **Store** — SQLite upsert with enrichment preservation
7. **Export** — JSON files for the visualizer

Additional pipeline capabilities:
- **Media matching** — Timestamp-based WhatsApp media → question matching
- **R2 upload** — Cloudflare R2 CDN for media files
- **Session images** — AI-generated backgrounds via Stable Horde
- **Quality audit** — Detects non-questions, low quality, and rejected/extracted overlaps
- **Connect quiz detection** — LLM classifier for themed connect sessions

```bash
cd v2/pipeline

# Full backfill (extract → store → media → export per date)
GEMINI_API_KEY=xxx python3 pipeline.py backfill

# Re-export from DB
python3 pipeline.py export

# Topic re-enrichment
GEMINI_API_KEY=xxx python3 pipeline.py reenrich --all

# Quality audit
python3 pipeline.py audit-quality
```

## Visualizer

A SvelteKit static site with:

- **Question feed** — Date-grouped timeline, full-text search, topic/tag/media filters
- **Quiz sessions** — Card gallery with AI backgrounds, question count filters
- **Session detail** — Interactive answer submission (multi-part, connect guess)
- **Question detail** — Full discussion thread, media gallery, like/save/flag
- **Highlights** — Topic distribution, member leaderboards, activity stats
- **Review** — Community voting on rejected extraction candidates
- **Marauder's Map auth** — Themed password gate

```bash
cd v2/visualizer
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
npm run build      # Static build for Netlify
```

## Privacy

Raw WhatsApp chat exports, the SQLite database, and derived data files containing personal information are excluded from this repository via `.gitignore`. Only pipeline code, schema definitions, and pre-exported static JSON are tracked.
